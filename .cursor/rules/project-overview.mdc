What already Set Up:

Initialized a Shopify app using the official Shopify CLI (Remix + App Bridge template).

Integrated Polaris (Shopifyâ€™s design system) for UI and App Bridge for embedding the app into the Shopify Admin.

Installed the app into your development store (e.g., skm-kart.myshopify.com).

Confirmed GraphiQL works at http://localhost:3457/graphiql â€” you can query the Admin GraphQL API.

Verified Remix frontend works independently at http://localhost:60595/hello.

ðŸ§  What i Want to Build:

i want to build a full AI-powered plugin for any Shopify store that:

Adds a conversational UI/chatbot into the storefront.

Enables users to search, browse, add to cart, and checkout â€” all through the chat interface.

Uses Claude (Anthropic LLM) to understand user input and generate appropriate responses.

Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to let Claude call webhooks that your app will expose to:

Query products

Create carts

Add/remove line items

Begin checkout

Show order status, etc.

final Goal Architecture Summary:

Claude (via chat) decides user intent.

Sends tool_use call to your /api/mcp.

Your /api/mcp handles the action using Shopify API.

Responds with structured output
